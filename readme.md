This project is baout a simple social media web Api for:

1. Adding a post to the databse
2. Retrieving post from The databases or messages
3. Updating a post
4. Deleting a post from the database.
   It supports the basic crud functionalities
   whicch are performed using the HTTP methods.
   it is written in Python using simple API. The database am using for this API is postgress. The version of python is 3.10, testing of the API is through a web browser as Simple API provides Documentation for your API and also Postman desktopn.
   I am yet to publish the url once the project is fully complete which can used.
